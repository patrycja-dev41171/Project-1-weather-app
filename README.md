# Weather App

This is my first public project on Github. 

The application was created for educational purposes.

The simple application uses the Open Weather API. 

Thanks to it, we can read information about the weather in a chosen place on earth.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned how to create simple React components. This was my first project using an external API. Working on this project caused me a few problems, but also a lot of satisfaction from solving them.
